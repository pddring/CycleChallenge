# CycleChallenge
I'm a teacher doing remote learning. All Day. Every day. My students are awesome but I'm missing cycling into work and back.

This project is an attempt to turn a cheap exercise bike into a digital exercise overlay so I can see how far I'm cycling whilst I'm working

## Kit
So far, I've ordered one of these https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B08PF3F4WJ to put under my desk

## Plans 
I'd like to use a microcontroller (haven't decided which one yet - microbit / arduino / esp82866 / pico) to detect the speed / distance travelled and then link that to a desktop app
which shows a live update on screen
